<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now a Ph.D. student of <a href='https://www.cis.pku.edu.cn'>the School of Intelligence Science and Technology</a> of Peking University, advised by <a href='https://muhanzhang.github.io'>Prof. Muhan Zhang</a>. Our group's github page is <a href='https://github.com/GraphPKU'>GraphPKU</a>.

My recent work is centered around graph neural network (GNN), particularly on GNN's expressivity. If you're also interested in related fields, welcome to contact me!
